# Privacy Notice

The application ASTo does not collect personal information of any kind.

The only network operation the application performs is when the vulnerability identification process is used. The vulnerability identification makes a network request to 'https://cve.circl.lu/api/search/' (can be changed in the settings), which maintains its own analytics.
