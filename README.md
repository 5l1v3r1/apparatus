ASTo is security analysis tool for IoT networks. It is developed to support the Apparatus security framework. ASTo is based on
[electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and
[cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/). The icons are provided by Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/icons/).

The application is still in prototyping stage, which means a lot of
functionality is being added with each commit, along with massive changes in
almost everything.

## Experimental features

ASTo can generate graph files from network captures files (.pcapng). This is part of an ongoing process to automate certain parts of the plebeian and time consuming task of graph creation. The `pcapng` import feature is only available from the implementation phase menu. It uses `tcpdump` to create a `txt` with the current timestamp and then uses the `txt` to create the `js` file of the graph. The `txt` file is created for debugging purposes and will be deprecated in later commits. The generated files are stored in the `graphs/implementation` directory.

Tcpdump is installed by default on Unix based systems. If `tcpdump` is not installed in your system, the tool will display an error message.

Currently, there are a few issues, depending on the `pcapng` file. There might be some duplicate network connections. IPs that run more than one services will be rendered as separate devices instead of a single device with multiple applications. I am still experimenting with the code and tcpdump filters. If you want to know more about how this feature works, visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Or3stis/apparatus/wiki#generate-graphs-from-pcapng-files-experimental-feature).

## To Use

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer. To download and install the app, type the following in your terminal:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Or3stis/apparatus.git
# Go into the repository
cd apparatus
# Install dependencies
npm install
# to run the app
npm start
```

Because the app is still in prototype stage, it is best to keep up to date with the most recent commits. To do so, before starting the app, type:

```bash
# inside the apparatus directory

# update to latest
git pull
```

Once the app starts, the first window (home screen) will ask you to choose which modeling phase would you like to perform analysis in. After you select a phase, you will be presented with three choices. The first is to create a new graph. The second choice is to load an existing graph. By default, you can only choose `.js` or `.json` files. The layout of the loaded graph is set in `/src/core/cyOptions.js` and it will run a breadth-first placement algorithm. The third option is the debug app, which loads a default graph used for debugging purposes.

You will find some example graphs in the `graphs` folder.

## Instructions

If you want to contribute that's great news ðŸ˜ƒ. Check the [contributing](https://github.com/Or3stis/apparatus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide. The application is being developed on Mac. That means that new commits might introduce breaking changes in other platforms. Especially commits that involve access to the file system. If something is not working, don't hesitate to create an [issue](https://github.com/Or3stis/apparatus/issues).

If you want to find out how the app works check the [wiki](https://github.com/Or3stis/apparatus/wiki).
